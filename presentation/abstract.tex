% Type the abstract of your talk here and replace the title and author's name by the title of your talk and your name. The abstract should be one paragraph of about ten lines or so. It should stand alone without external references. The title should be relatively short, preferably printing on a single line. The abstract is intended to give a reader some idea of the kind of thing that the talk will be discussing. Part of the role of the abstract is to attract an audience so you should attempt to make the talk sound interesting. The abstract of the talk does not need to state the main results of the talk (whereas the abstract of a paper probably should attempt to do that). As the speaker, you do not want to give away everything that you might say in the talk. In particular, you may want to keep the main result as a surprise for the actual talk. The abstract of your talk is probably going to be different from the abstract of your paper. Below is the complete abstract of a talk with the title above that I gave at the Tom Brylawski Memorial Conference in Chapel Hill in October 2008.

% In his chapter on constructions in Neil White's book ``Theory of Matroids",
% Tom Brylawski raised as a research problem exploring the set of excluded
% minors for the union of two minor-closed classes of matroids. This talk will
% present the solution to this problem for the union of the classes of binary
% and ternary matroids. This is joint work with Dillon Mayhew, Bogdan Oporowski,
% and Geoff Whittle.


Tricoloring is a knot invariant that seeks to differentiate knots based on
whether or not the diagrams of a knot can be colored with three colors
under certain restrictions. This talk will introduce knots and
explore tricoloring both in terms of diagrams and the knot group.
