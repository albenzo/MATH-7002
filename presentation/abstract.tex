\begin{abstract}
  Tricoloring is a knot invariant that differentiates knots based on
  whether or not their diagrams can be colored with three colors.
  This talk will introduce knots and explore tricoloring both in terms of
  coloring diagrams and the knot group. In addition we mention extensions of
  tricoloring to using an arbitrary number of colors.
